# Terminal-Based Maze Solver

This Python script generates random mazes, allows users to find a path from the start to the end, and displays the result in the terminal. The maze elements are color-coded for a visually appealing display. Users can choose to generate a path and print the maze, generate another puzzle, or exit the game.

### Installation

No installation is required. Just make sure you have Python installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python maze_solver.py

2. Enter the size of the maze (n x n) and the percentage of walls.

3. Choose an option:
   - P (Generate path and Print)
   - G (Generate another puzzle)
   - E (Exit)

4. If you choose to generate a path and print the maze, the script will display the generated maze and the found path.

5. Optionally, you can generate another puzzle or exit the program.

## Features

- **Maze Generation:** Randomly generates mazes with specified size and wall percentage.
- **Pathfinding:** Uses BFS to find the optimal path from the start to the end in the generated maze.
- **User Interaction:** Provides a simple terminal interface for users to navigate through the maze-solving process.
